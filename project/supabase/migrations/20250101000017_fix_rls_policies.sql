/*
  # Fix RLS Policies - Infinite Recursion Issue
  
  This migration fixes the infinite recursion issue in RLS policies
  by using a more efficient approach to check admin roles without
  creating circular references.
  
  The issue was caused by admin policies querying the users table
  which triggered the same policy again, creating an infinite loop.
