  # Fix guest_riders RLS policies for anonymous users

  1. Security Changes
    - Add policy for anonymous users to insert guest rider records
    - Add policy for anonymous users to update guest rider records (for upsert operations)
    - Remove conflicting policy that prevents duplicate emails

  2. Changes Made
    - Allow anonymous users to create new guest rider entries
    - Allow anonymous users to update existing guest rider entries for upsert functionality
    - Fix RLS policies to support the guest booking flow

  3. Notes
    - These policies are essential for the guest booking process to work
    - Anonymous users can only create/update guest rider records, not read all records
    - Maintains security while enabling guest functionality
